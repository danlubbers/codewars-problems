// John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He has been said that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method to getting it right.

// John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

// Last time he did these calculations he caught a headache so could you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

// #Example: wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3) should return "ten"

// #Notes:

// all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
// 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
// the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

// My Answer
// function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
//     let numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'ten', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'twenty'];
//     let rollWidthInMeters = 52 * .01;
//     let rollLength = 10;

//     return l*w*h === 0 ? 'zero' : numbers[Math.ceil(2*h*(l+w)/rollWidthInMeters/rollLength * 1.15)];
// }

// Best Practice
function toWord(n) {
    let words = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'ten', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'twenty'];
    return words[n];
}

function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
    if ([l, w, h].indexOf(0) >= 0) {
        return 'zero' 
    } else {
        let roll = 5.2;
        let percentage = 1.15;
        let need = (l*h) * 2 + (w*h) * 2;
        return toWord(Math.ceil(need/roll * percentage));
    }

}

console.log(wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3), "ten")
console.log(wallpaper(6.3, 4.5, 3.29), "sixteen");
console.log(wallpaper(7.8, 2.9, 3.29), "sixteen");
